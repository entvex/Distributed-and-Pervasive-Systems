\chapter{Leader Election} \label{ch:leaderElection}

A leader performs sort of the conductor role in a distributed system and is responsible for maintaining consensus. Putting this task on one job has the benefit of avoiding synchronization conflicts when individual nodes has to update their state, but also ensures consistency in the process and provides safety as well. Ideally, the nodes should not know each-other and send commands among them, but solely relay on the leader telling them what to compute. Therefore the task of selecting the leader becomes crucial. In this chapter we will look two popular algorithms to do so, the Bully and the ring algorithm, and then discuss other ways to elect the most appropriate leader.

As seen in figure \ref{fig:data} on the left. The bully election algorithm starts by (a) Process 1 holds an election because it notices 4 has crashed. (b)
Processes 2 and 3 respond, telling 1 to stop. (c) Now 2 and 3 each hold an
election. (d) Process 3 tells 2 to stop. (e) Process 3 wins and tells everyone.

As seen in figure \ref{fig:data} on the right. The ring algorithm and it beings by 2 and 5 start election message independently. Both messages continue to circulate the ring and at some point both messages will go all the way around. In the last step not shown on the figure 2 and 5 convert their election messages to coordinator message and then all processes recognize highest numbered process as new coordinator.
