\chapter{Real-Time Ethernet} \label{ch:realTimeEthernet}

Ethernet is a networking standard used in local area networks (LAN) that can a support a real-time system using packet switching, high bandwidth and low interference. We will look at the history of Ethernet and what challenges lay back then, a single segment Ethernet setup with CSMA/CD technology, then multi segment Ethernet with the spanning-tree protocol (STP) and a implementation of it.
