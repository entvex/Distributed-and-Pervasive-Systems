Need for being able to consistently refer to an entity. An entity can be anything that can be operated on.
Names are not entities, constant or consistent.

Names are resolved -> When we translate the name into data or an actionable resource

IP-address is an attribute

Naming navigation -> Getting assistance from other servers to resolve a name

 - Flat names
	Good for small systems

 - Structured names
	Highly scalable
		fx. DNS
			Mediator between humans and computers
				13 root name servers
					locations are confidential
				example.com is a subdomain of com
		FQDN - unambigous and exact name for a specific computer
			Ends with a dot '.'
		The name server that loads a complete zone are called authorative for that zone.

 - Attribute based names
	Hard to scale.
	Directory systems.
	X.500 standard	ISO-1997
		Includes LDAP

This is a bottomless rabbit hole.
