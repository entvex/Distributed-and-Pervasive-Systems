\section{Scheduling} \label{sc:scheduling}

- Introduction
Arrival time, release time, deadlines

What are jobs? Tasks?
Have the basic definition written down (at least the Task/J one)


In scheduling the aim is to meet all hard deadlines and handle soft deadlines of jobs in the best possible manner and avoid deadlocks while doing so. The arrival time of a job is the moment in time it arrives at a processor, while the
release time of a job is the moment in time it becomes available for execution. A task can have different job types and such as perodic, sporadic and Aperiodic. A task is a set of jobs known at the start of the system or trigger by a external event.
A periodic task is defined by three parameters:
%TODO: Tror du der er en måde at skubbe dem mere sammen, så der er mere plads?
\begin{itemize}
	\item The release time r of the first periodic job.
	\item The period p, which is a periodic time interval, at the start of which a periodic job is released.
	\item The execution time e of each periodic job.
\end{itemize}
and is written as (\textit{r},\textit{p},\textit{e})




- Schedulers
Put in illustrations/drawings from exercises. We need a few examples
\subsection{Rate-monotonic scheduler}

\subsection{Deadline-first scheduler}

\subsection{Least-slacktime-first scheduler}


\subsection{Resource control}
Write about resource control/deadlock
Priority inheirtance
Priority ceiling
