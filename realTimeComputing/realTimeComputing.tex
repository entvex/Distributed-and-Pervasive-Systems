\chapter{Real-Time Computing} \label{ch:realTimeComputing}

For a system to be real-time it needs to some logical correctness in due time and respond to events before a certain deadline. When discussing real-time systems in simulation, it means that the system clock is equal to the real-time clock. If events are set to happen at 1400, they happen at 1400. In enterprise systems, real-time often mean that tasks should happen without a significant delay. In this chapter we discuss deterministic and nondeterministic systems, how scheduling can be managed in a system with multiple processes and how to manage resources in such a system.
