Key points:

    Importance of distributed systems 

    Moore's law
        Transistor size.

        The number of transistors on ICs doubles approx. every two years, i.e. exponential growth. (Moore's 2nd / Rock's law: the cost of a semiconductor chip fabrication plant doubles every four years.)

    Koone's law
        Drop in power requirements per processor task
        
        Figure: The no. of computations per Joule of energy is doubling approx. every 1.57 years. Koomey: \at a xed computing load, the amount of battery you need will fall by a factor of two every year and a half."

    Kryder's law
        Hard disk space growth

        An exponential increase in disk capacity at constant form factor aka. areal density (measure of the quantity of bits that can be stored on a given length of track, area of surface, or volume of a storage medium).
    
    What do we expect to learn from this course?

    Where would we find these theories in practice?
