\section{Logical Clock}\label{sc:logicalClock}

Good for managing ordering and scheduling of events in a system without needing to exist within the domain of real time. Time is defined in terms different from \textit{t(x)}

Definitions from Lamport
    a->b
    Concurrency


Pros/Cons

lamport clock - The one he talked about in the lecture
    A sample could be prepared from the BlinkToRadio example in sensor networks.

heartbeat clock - A clock which is ticked forward based on a 'heartbeat' that all parts of the system have access too.
    Can't find any sources for this quickly. It may need a bit of extra
