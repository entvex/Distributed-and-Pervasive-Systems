\subsection{The need for logical clocks}

\subsection{The happened-before relation}

Define the happened-before relation. I guess most can be found in the article "Time, Clocks, and the Ordering of Events in a Distributed System" or in the slides.

\subsection{Lamport time-stamps}

- Invented by Leslie Lamport in 1978.
- It is an algorithm to determine the ordering of events in a system.
- Simply an local counter that each process increments before an event and attaches when it sends a message. The receiving party compares the received value with its own and whichever value is the greatest is then assigned to the counter of the received process.

To evaluate this is in practical setting, we define a simple Python application using MPI (Message Passing Interface) that demonstrates Lamport time-stamps in action.
