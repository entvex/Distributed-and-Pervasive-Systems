\chapter{Synchronization} \label{ch:synchronization}

In a distributed system it is important to have a common notion of time in order to properly synchronize and coordinate jobs between nodes. We will look at two types of clocks, a logical clock and a real time clock, how to implement both in a distributed system, pinpoint caveats and show practical examples.
