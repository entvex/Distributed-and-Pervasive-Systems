\section{Real Clock}\label{sc:realClock}

\subsection{The need for real clocks}

\subsection{PTP - Precision Time Protocol}

- IEEE 1588
- Explain the basics. Applications?
- Why is suited/designed for packet-switched networks?
- Does it scale well? Performance?
- Show Phase 1 and Phase 2.
- Master slave.

\subsection{Software vs. hardware}

Why is it good to timestamp at the lowest layer possible in the network stack close to transmitting via the physical layer?
