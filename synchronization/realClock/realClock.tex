\section{Real Clock}\label{sc:realClock}

Short introduction to real clocks here.
An attempt to synchronize discrete systems around real time, with different algorithms making different balances between precision and resource requirements.

PTP (most important)
NTP
RBIS

\subsection{The need for real clocks}

Why do we need real clocks? Can't we just use the logical ones u just talked about?

\subsection{PTP - Precision Time Protocol}

- IEEE 1588
- Explain the basics. Applications?
- Why is suited/designed for packet-switched networks?
- Does it scale well? Performance?
- Show Phase 1 and Phase 2.
- Master slave.

\subsection{Software vs. hardware}

Why is it good to timestamp at the lowest layer possible in the network stack close to transmitting via the physical layer?
