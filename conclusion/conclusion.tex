Throughout this report we have discussed various methods for implementing distributed systems in stable and scalable ways. We have discussed the concept of time-synchronization through different clock-types and how they can be applied to maintain timelines between different applications. Real-time distribution in the system can be achieved, once there is consensus on time domain. Other problems can occur however and we discussed the concepts of consistency, fault tolerance and consensus, which give us much needed stability by eliminating many of the fragile factors from the architecture of the distributed system.

Middleware has been an economic driver for the growth of distributed systems in recent years, by simplifying development of new systems, by abstracting away the complexities of dealing with system distribution.

Positioning shows us methods for exploring physical and virtual worlds, and integrating our systems into them. Location and tracking have been of special interest due to their applications in various fields.

%Key points:
%	How have we approached bypassing the limitations imposed by the laws presented in the introduction
%	Surprising discoveries from the class?
%	The collective effort of devices is greater than the sum of their parts.
%	Computers will always need more processing power and distributed systems are a potential method for gaining additional processing power at low cost.
