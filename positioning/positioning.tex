\chapter{Positioning} \label{ch:positioning}

This chapter is about recognizing the position of a device either in absolute coordinates or relative to an earlier fix. It will also cover absolute positioning where position is measuring by distance to fixed beacons in our environment. Relative positioning is on the other hand about estimating our position relative to a previous position. Finally it will discuss hybrid positioning which is a combination of measured position and estimated movement to enhance the accuracy of the position.
