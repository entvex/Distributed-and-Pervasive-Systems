\chapter{Positioning} \label{ch:positioning}

This chapter is about recognizing the position of a device either in absolute coordinates or relative to an earlier fix. We will cover absolute positioning where we derive our position by measuring our distance to fixed beacons in our environment. Relative positioning is on the other hand about estimating our position relative to a previous position. Finally we will discuss hybrid positioning which is a combination of measuring our position and estimating movement until a new absolute measurement is made.
