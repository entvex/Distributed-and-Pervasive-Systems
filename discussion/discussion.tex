\chapter{Discussion} \label{ch:discussion}
Throughout this report, different technologies have been studied in conjunction with the development of distributed and pervasive systems. The different concepts that have been studied all provide different aspects of distributed and/or pervasive systems. The technologies that have been covered, have mainly been technologies that can be used in conjunction with distributed systems.

In chapter \textbf{\ref{ch:realTimeComputing} Real-Time Computing}, the aspect of interest is have been finite and timed automatas, process scheduling and resource control. The chapter gives a good overview of the solutions to problems that can occur in distributed systems, with processes and resources shared between the internal systems.

In chapter \textbf{\ref{ch:synchronization} Synchronization}, the concepts of logical and real clocks are inspected. Throughout the chapter synchronization of different parts in the system are studied, with concepts like the Lamport timestamps, for logical clocks, NTP and PTP, for real clocks. The chapter gives an overall picture of the solutions for systems with the need of synchronization.

In chapter \textbf{\ref{ch:realTimeEthernet} Real-Time Ethernet}, 

In chapter \textbf{\ref{ch:middleware} Middleware}

In chapter \textbf{\ref{ch:consistency} Consistency}

In chapter \textbf{\ref{ch:faultToleranceandconsensus} Fault Tolerance and Consensus}

In chapter \textbf{\ref{ch:leaderElection} Leader Election}

In chapter \textbf{\ref{ch:positioning} Positioning}

All of the above technologies and concepts all matter when talking about distributed and pervasive systems. It is not simple to use one of the concepts without also using other in the overall system, they all reference to each part of an overall system and cannot be forgotten. 

%Key points:

%We have learned various techniques that can be applied to the development of distributed systems to both enable us to provide .... various good stuffs.

%Of particular interest to the authors were the technologies surrounding the topics of ...?

%Why did we do this?
