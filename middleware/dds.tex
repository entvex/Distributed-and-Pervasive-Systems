\section{Data Distribution Service (DDS) as middleware}

DDS is a publish-subscribe standard by the OMG group and is available as open-source or commercial implementations like OpenDDS or RTI Connext. DDS supports topic, content or type based subscribing, where a topic is a somewhat arbitrary general naming of a message, content is certain properties evaluated at runtime of a message, and type is using a static type schema of a higher-level language, for example CSharp or Java, to distinguish messages. Because DDS is based on publish-subscribe, it provides a flexible and adaptable architecture, with a large number of configuration properties and ranging from one-to-one to many-to-many communication support.
