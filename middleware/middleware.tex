\chapter{Middleware} \label{ch:middleware}

Middleware is a layer of software residing on every machine between the application-rich user-space and internal working area of the operating-system, the kernel-space. It serves the purpose of masking a complex underlaying structure of heterogeneous application interfaces and providing a simple, accessible and consistent distributed programming environment. In this chapter we look at various communication patterns for middleware, the publish-subscribe standard Data Distribution Service (DDS) by the OMG group and finally the Java remote method invocation (RMI), a object-oriented equivalent of remote procedure calls (RPC).
