\section{Consistency models}

Consistency models are used in distributed systems like shared memory storage, filesystems and databases to amend the issues that distributed write and read access could have to such a system. A consistency model define a given set of rules a operation must follow when accessing the data and can be seen as a contract between a running process (the programmer) and the system. If the process comply with this contract, then memory will be consistent and the output of reading, writing, or updating the memory will be predictable. For example in relational database systems, transactions abide by the ACID\footnote{ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) is a set of properties of database transactions intended to guarantee validity even in the event of errors, power failures, etc.} principle, where consistency ensures that any transition will bring the database from one valid state to the next and that data should follow a set of rules. Assume a relational database in a cluster that contain row $R_x$ and that this row is replicated to nodes $Node_a$ and $Node_b$. A client $C_i$ then writes $R_x$ on $Node_a$. Subsequently another client $C_j$ reads $R_i$ from $Node_b$. A consistency model has to determine if $C_j$ sees the write from $C_i$ or not.

Consistency models can be classified as strong or weak. A strong consistency model guarantees that the order and visibility of updates are equivalent to that of a centralized (non-replicated) system with only one process, that is updates are immediately replicated to all nodes. A weak consistency model does not make this guarantee. We will now look at both strong and weak models and consider them for a distributed system:

\textbf{Linearizability}: A strong consistency model that ensures that all operations appear to have run atomically (in isolation, independent from concurrent processes) in an order that is consistent with the global real-time ordering of operations. If a distributed database follows this model, than it would appear centralized to its clients. No matter how clients execute operations, the result would be the same as if they we executed in some sequential order and these operations appear in their order of executing.

\textbf{Sequential consistency}: A strong consistency model that mimics the linearizability one, but does not require that two independent operations from different clients respect the real-time ordering of operations in a system. With this model, operations can be re-ordered as long as each node observe the ordering consistently. A benefit of the two strong consistency models is that a client or programmer can replace a centralized system with a distributed one without facing data consistency issues.

\textbf{Client-centric consistency:} 

\textbf{Casual consistency}: 

\textbf{Eventual consistency}: A
